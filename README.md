## QTmsg.io

This project was a protoype encrypted chat client I made early on during my journey with Python. It was written in Python 2 and Javascript with JQuery. With my itch scrached, it has since been abandoned. It used Diffie-Hellman key exchange to pass a random key to all the chat partipants and allowed them to chat privately. It was a single page app. Since Python2 has been discontinued it is no longer safe to use.
